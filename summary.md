## OKRs == Objectives + Key Results

Objective (1)-->(has many) Key Results.
OKRs are a management methodology to ensure focus on same issues company-wide.

| Objectives |  Key Results |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| "WHAT is to be achieved, no more no less" | "benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective" |
| significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational | specific, time-bound, aggressive yet realistic, measurable and verifiable |
| Long lived, often year or more, can be rolled over | Quarter or less, evolve as work progresses |

Objective = sum of all Key Results, if all key results achieved then objective should be complete

## Quotes

- *"Ideas are easy. Execution is everything."*
- Edwin Locke: *"hard goals" drive performance more effectively than easy goals. Second, specific hard goals "produce a higher level of output" than vaguely worded ones.*
- A two-year Deloitte study found that no single factor has more impact than *"clearly defined goals that are written down and shared freely. . . . Goals create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction."*
- Andy Grove *"Bad companies, are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them."*

## Warning

Focusing on goals solely leads to tunnel vision, infighting and possible unethical behavior. Gives example of Wells Fargo.
