## The HP Way aka MBO

The author as a former employee of HP in it's heyday is heavily influenced by HP’s internal engineering management training program called "The HP Way" aka "MBO-Management by Objectives".

MBO has two fundamental principles 

1. Motivate people to get them to do their best work (see Patton quote below).
2. How to meaningfully measure progress, i.e, you can release all the features you want, but if it doesn’t solve the underlying business problem, you haven’t really solved anything.

### How to do MBO the wrong way

- Executives and  stakeholders all come up with the quarterly "roadmap" of features and projects
- They pass them down to the product teams, telling them *how* to solve the underlying business problems
- Teams just flesh out the details, code and test, with little understanding of the bigger context, and even less belief in the solutions aka feature factories
- Progress is measured by output and not outcome.

## Notable quotes

- General George Patton: "Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what you need done and let them surprise you with their results."
- HP’s tagline of their prime era, "When Performance Is Measured By Results"
