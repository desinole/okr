These notes are from reading Christina Wodtke's Radical Focus: Achieving Your Most Important Goals with Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). The book follows the protagonist story angle similar to The Phoenix Project and makes for an easy read.

## The HP Way aka MBO

The author as a former employee of HP in it's heyday is heavily influenced by HP’s internal engineering management training program called "The HP Way" aka "MBO-Management by Objectives".

MBO has two fundamental principles 

1. Motivate people to get them to do their best work (see Patton quote below).
2. How to meaningfully measure progress, i.e, you can release all the features you want, but if it doesn’t solve the underlying business problem, you haven’t really solved anything.

### How to do MBO the wrong way

- Executives and  stakeholders all come up with the quarterly "roadmap" of features and projects
- They pass them down to the product teams, telling them *how* to solve the underlying business problems
- Teams just flesh out the details, code and test, with little understanding of the bigger context, and even less belief in the solutions aka feature factories
- Progress is measured by output and not outcome.

## How MBOs translate into OKRs

1. Set inspiring and measurable goals.
2. Ensure your team is always making progress toward that desired end state.
3. Set a cadence that makes sure the group both remembers what they are trying to accomplish and holds each other accountable.

- O stands for Objective. Objective is what you want to do (Launch a killer game!)
- KR for Key Results Key Results are how you know if you’ve achieved them ("Downloads of 25K/ Day","Revenue $50K/ Day").
- OKRs are set annually and/or quarterly to unite the company behind a vision.
- Key Results keep the Objective real.

Important/ Urgent matrix. It’s a simple four-square with two axes.
*can we draw this?*
time-constrain things that are important but not urgent, thus making them urgent.
Starting every week with a public setting of priorities is powerful. You commit to the team and to each other to make the Objective occur. A Friday celebration of what’s been accomplished is the second bookend of a high-performing team’s week. This commit/ celebrate cadence creates a habit of execution.
startup’s enemy is time, and the enemy of timely execution is distraction.


## Notable quotes

- General George Patton: "Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what you need done and let them surprise you with their results."
- HP’s tagline of their prime era, "When Performance Is Measured By Results"
- "It’s not important to protect an idea. It’s important to protect the time it takes to make it real."
